day 4:
(y/n) is the first xanthe more unravelled than the second xanthe?

today is 11.20.2020, less than 20 days before I need everything working well.
what is everything?
in this case, it is a suite of interactive, accessible, and connected pages for 
students, teachers, and visitors.
basic assumption is that each user is a document.
    if webdev wingbird is activated, which mode do you want?
        webdev wingbird modes (i>=1): learning, dofor, non-doing
    algorithms i have certain: 
    1. line by line understand + console.log
    2. split in half, LR, repeat
    3. call webdev wingbird
        updated 11.22.2020
    4. physically do something else for a while
    5. google the problem
    6. talk about it to someone

before the beginning: maximum 20 students, 10 wingbirds, scalable visitors page (ads?)

always reward good choice 
why would i every dream of 
why would i ever try a new character

entrance.ejs:  this is the public access page. 
welcome. role choice of student, wingbird, or visitors?guest? (icon)
below this first choice, there is a slogan/clue <br> form+submit button (named "enter")
    student(email validation)
    wingbird(WB.email validation)
    ?visitor(captcha and ip)
every task has a timer, on submit with answer
that value is called ${taskNum}timerVal and saved to database.
