quent antagonist Niels Bohr spent a great deal of time inventing
and drawing thought experiments. Even today physicists talk about
"toy systems" when they can't work with the full mathematics.
Many complex enterprises begin with things so simple they seem
laughable. Language textbooks are certainly like that: Lingling
meets Mr. Mango, and asks when will they go to the movies; they
part without another word.  Only after several hundred pages--
and a thousand new vocabulary words--can Lingling speak freely
to Mr. Mango.
        Let me start, then with a simple exercise to help think about
