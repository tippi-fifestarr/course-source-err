What’s next?

Today, you were able to connect to a MongoDB database from a Node.js script, retrieve a list of databases in your cluster, and view the results in your console. Nice!

In future posts in this series, we’ll dive into each of the CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations as well as topics like change streams, transactions, and the aggregation pipeline, so you’ll have the tools you need to successfully interact with data in your databases.

In the meantime, check out the following resources:
