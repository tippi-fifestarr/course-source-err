if you know tippi's real name, then you can operate on this site as a wingbird.
a wingbird gets to choose from all of fontawesome free icons for their icon
lucky you!  after you leave tutorial purgatory, you can do things such as:
check your messages
make a mission (activity)
tune in to MPC<-Wradio>
secret bonus content for me special friendz

-------
if you follow the steps on the portal page (two spinning worlds and a name and iconname)
it will create a new document in my mongodb for you with your name, icon, and, if you correctly choose "other" (wingbird is bird); this document can allow your progress to persist over time and across devices.
